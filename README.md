# Drug-Classification
Classification is a machine learning technique that tells the computer program to learn from a dataset and categorize the data into classes. This technique can be performed on structured and unstructured data.The purpose of this project is to classify drugs based on biological factors. The biological factors are blood pressure, blood cholesterol, age, sex, and the concentration of sodium to potassium. Classifying drugs is important because different types of drugs can be used for legal, medical, and treatment purposes especially for wide-spread diseases. 

Steps to implement drug classification in Python
1. Import the libraries and load the dataset.
2. Descriptive statistics including checking for null values.
3. Create stack columns for drugs taken by age, sex, blood pressure, chloesterol levels,and concentration of sodium to potassium.
4. Encode cateogrical features into numerical values.
5. Split the dataset into a training and test set of all the numeric variables.
6. Train the models with the training and test datasets of all the numeric variables.
7. Intercept the reports of all the numeric variables.

Conclusion: The drugs are mostly classified by Age and Na to K ratio whereas blood pressure, blood chloesterol, and sex does a poor performance of classifying the drugs.
