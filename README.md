# Drug-Classification
Classification is a machine learning technique that tells the computer program to learn from a dataset and categorize the data into classes. This technique can be performed on structured and unstructured data.The purpose of this project is to classify drugs based on biological factors. The biological factors are blood pressure, blood cholesterol, age, sex, and the concentration of sodium to potassium. Classifying drugs is important because different types of drugs can be used for legal, medical, and treatment purposes especially for wide-spread diseases. 



The drugs are mostly classified by Age and Na to K ratio whereas blood pressure, blood chloesterol, and sex does a poor performance of classifying the drugs.
